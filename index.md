## Welcome to Rsolander's Project Page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rsolander/rsolander.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rsolander/rsolander.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## HotJar Feedback App

I built this app to integrate with the feedback tool installed on our externally-facing sites in an effort to collect and process feedback data and responses. Our marketing team and website owners use the app to discover patterns in the types of feedback being recieved (good vs bad) as well as where various types of feedback are coming from (are users from certain countries having a worse / better experience than others?).
